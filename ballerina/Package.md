To use the HubSpot Deals API connector, you must have access to the HubSpot API through a HubSpot developer account and a HubSpot App under it. Therefore you need to register for a developer account at HubSpot if you don't have one already.

### Step 1: Create/Login to a HubSpot Developer Account

If you have an account already, go to the [HubSpot developer portal](https://app.hubspot.com/)

If you don't have a HubSpot Developer Account you can sign up to a free account [here](https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started)

### Step 2 (Optional): Create a [Developer Test Account](https://developers.hubspot.com/beta-docs/getting-started/account-types#developer-test-accounts) under your account

Within app developer accounts, you can create developer test accounts to test apps and integrations without affecting any real HubSpot data.

**_These accounts are only for development and testing purposes. In production you should not use Developer Test Accounts._**

1. Go to Test Account section from the left sidebar.
